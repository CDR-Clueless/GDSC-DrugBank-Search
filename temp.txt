Although Food and Drug Administration guidelines require that potential interactions of investigational drugs with P-gp be explored, often this information does not enter into the literature. As such, we developed a high-throughput screen (HTS) to identify substrates of P-gp from a series of chemical libraries including the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences Pharmaceutical Collection NPC, 2,816 compounds), testing a total of 10,804 compounds, most of which have known mechanisms of action. We used the CellTiter-Glo viability assay to test library compounds against the parental KB-3-1 human cervical adenocarcinoma cell line and the colchicine-selected sub-line KB-8-5-11 that over-expresses P-gp. KB-8-5-11 cells were also tested in the presence of a P-gp inhibitor (tariquidar) to assess reversability of transporter-mediated resistance. Of the tested compounds, a total of 90 P-gp substrates were identified including 55 newly identified P-gp substrates. Substrates were confirmed using an orthogonal killing assay against HEK-293 cells transfected with P-gp. As exemplars, we confirmed that AT7159 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor); AT9283, (Janus kinase 2/3 inhibitor); ispinesib (kinesin spindle protein inhibitor); gedatolisib (PKI-587, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/mammalian target of rampamycin inhibitor); GSK-690693 (AKT inhibitor); and KW-2478 (heat shock protein 90 inhibitor) were substrates , and direct ATPase stimulation was assessed. ABCG2 was also found to confer high levels of resistance to AT9283, GSK-690693 and gedatolisib, while ispinesib, AT7519 and KW-2478 were weaker substrates. Combinations of P-gp substrates and inhibitors were assessed to demonstrate on-target synergistic cell killing. This data will be of use in determining understanding how chemotherapeutic agents will cross the blood-brain barrier."], "protocol": ["The HeLa derivative cell line, KB-3-1, and its colchicine-selected, P-gp-overexpressing subline, KB-8-5-11 were maintained in DMEM with 10% FCS and Pen/Strep with glutamine at 37 degree C in 5% CO2.  For KB-8-5-11 cells, colchicine was added to the medium at a concentration of 100 ng/mL. HEK-293 cells transfected with empty vector (pcDNA) or vector containing human ABCB1 (MDR-19) or ABCG2 (R-5) have been described previously (Robey, Lin, Qiu, Chan & Bates, 2011) and were maintained in EMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, Pen/Strep and glutamine with 2 mg/ml G418 to select for the expression of the transporter. Cultures were confirmed to be free of mycoplasma infection using the MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, Walkersville, MD). For the screen, assay medium was identical to culture medium except for KB-8-5-11 where colchicine was excluded from the medium.", "", "All cell lines were plated into 1536-well plates at 500 cells/well in 5 uL media.  Compounds were then pinned in dose-response using a 1536-head pin tool (Kalypsis, San Diego, CA) and plates were incubated at 37 degree C in 5% CO2 for an additional 72 h. CellTiter-Glo reagent (Promega) was dispensed into the wells, incubated for 5 min and luminescence was read on a ViewLux instrument (Perkin-Elmer). Cytotoxic compounds were defined as those that yielded a curve class of -1.1, -1.2, -2.1, -2.2, -2.3, or -2.4, a maximum response of >50% and an AC50 of < 10 uM. Cherry-picked hits from screening analysis were tested with both the KB pair of cell lines, and the pcDNA (empty vector control) and MDR-19 (P-gp overexpressing) pair were tested, in the absence and presence of tariquidar."], "comment": ["Compound Ranking:", "", "1.
